				Sometime last year, I started thinking of a way to send money to people
				without asking for their account number because I am a ‘shy’ person and
				I didn’t want to come off as assuming people need(ed) the measly
				5,000NGN I was planning to give out so I thought. What if there’s a
				place where people could go put their account details and get money
				without my involvement?
			</p>

			<p>
				That’s what sparked the idea but unfortunately, I didn’t have the time
				to build the project until I started learning Ruby on Rails this year
				and I thought this would be a great project to horn my Ruby skills.
			</p>

				At the moment, I am the sole donor to this project, if you would like to
				contribute/donate to this project. Please checkout the Contribute page
