            Sometime last year, I started thinking of a way to send money to
            people without asking for their account number because I am a ‘shy’
            person and I didn’t want to come off as assuming people need(ed) the
            measly 5,000NGN I was planning to give out so I thought. What if
            there’s a place where people could go put their account details and
            get money without my involvement?
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s what sparked the idea but unfortunately, I didn’t have the
            time to build the project until I started learning Ruby on Rails
            this year and I thought this would be a great project to horn my
            Ruby skills.
